# Boston-House-Price-Prediction
This is a price prediction model of Boston Housing dataset that have been scaled with inflation consideration.
The dataset for this project originates from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. The Boston housing data was collected in 1978 and each of the 506 entries represent aggregated data about 14 features for homes from various suburbs in Boston, Massachusetts.
The attribute "medv" has been scaled taking inflation from 1978-2021 into consideration




* I deployed a web app on Heroku using Streamlit to create an interactive model from my [Predicting Boston House Price](https://github.com/DanielBayo/Boston-House-Price-Prediction) repo. [Check it out](https://bostonhouseprice.herokuapp.com/)!
